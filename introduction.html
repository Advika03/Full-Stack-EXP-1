        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think, learn, and solve problems. It encompasses various techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.</p>
        <h2>What are the 4 types of artificial intelligence?</h2>

        <p>Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, explained that AI can be categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows.
            <br>

            <b><br>Type 1: Reactive machines.</b> These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
            <b><br>Type 2: Limited memory.</b> These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.
            <b><br>Type 3: Theory of mind.</b> Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.
            <b><br>Type 4: Self-awareness.</b> In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist.
